# Spring Boot Microservices with TDD

This repository contains a collection of Spring Boot microservices developed following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Each microservice demonstrates different aspects of development and testing, utilizing various technologies and frameworks.

## Features

- Multiple Spring Boot microservices
- Focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Examples of MongoDB integration
- Integration testing with Karate
- Behavior-driven testing with Cucumber
- Use of Maven and Gradle as build systems
- Unit testing with JUnit and Spock

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Maven
- Gradle
- MongoDB

## Project Structure

Each folder in the repository root represents an independent microservice. Within each microservice, you'll find:

- Source code in `src/main/java`
- Tests in `src/test/java`
- Configuration files for Maven or Gradle

## Running the Projects

To run a specific microservice:

1. Navigate to the microservice folder
2. Execute the corresponding command based on the build system:

   With Maven:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   With Gradle:
   ```
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

## Running Tests

To run tests for a microservice:

With Maven:
```
mvn test
```

With Gradle:
```
./gradlew test
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Please ensure you follow TDD principles when adding new features or microservices.
